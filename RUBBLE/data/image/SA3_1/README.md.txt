# OFOS Image Dataset – Demo Version

This repository contains a **limited demo subset** of the original OFOS images.

Only a small number of images from one station (SAX_1) are provided to:

- Demonstrate folder structure
- Allow execution of the image selection script
- Ensure pipeline reproducibility

---

## Important

This is NOT the complete image dataset.

The full OFOS archive used in the RUBBLE project is:

- Too large for GitHub hosting
- Stored separately in institutional archives

For access to the complete dataset, please contact the corresponding author.

## Folder Structure
